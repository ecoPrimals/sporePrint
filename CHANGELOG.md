## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-17 — Data, analysis, and polish

### Added

- `technical/HARDWARE_COST_ANALYSIS.md` — The f64 Vulkan discovery ($0.044/run,
  9.9× DF64 uplift, $15K basement vs ICER/cloud cost analysis, NUCLEUS scaling
  math, GPU DF64 TFLOPS table for consumer cards)
- `architecture/EVOLUTION_TIMELINE.md` — Day-by-day 27-day sprint record.
  Velocity analysis (checks/day per sprint), what the timeline proves about
  K-Nome methodology, the infrastructure that made velocity possible
- `science/CROSS_SPRING_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` — The Anderson thread across 5 domains,
  paper-by-paper cross-spring dependency tables, convergent predictions where
  independent springs agree on the same number, the groundSpring anomaly,
  open questions awaiting wet-lab validation

### Updated

- `README.md` — Added "The Five Numbers" table ($0.044, 9.9×, 27 days, 20,695+,
  175+), new Hardware/Cost reading path, references to 3 new docs, improved
  document map with annotations

### Document count at v0.2.0: 47 files

## Roadmap

### [0.2.0] — Methodology completion
- Complete baseCamp Paper 14 (sovereign compute hardware) and add to science/
- Add `methodology/CONSTRAINED_EVOLUTION_FORMAL.md` companion diagrams
- Add `architecture/` diagrams (NUCLEUS bonding model, spring data flow)

### [0.3.0] — Cross-validation + living data
- Wire check counts to live CI badges from spring repositories
- Add `science/CROSS_SPRING_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` — how baseCamp papers draw from multiple springs
- Begin peer review prep for Paper 01 (Anderson QS)

### [1.0.0] — Standalone published whitepaper
- Own git history (extracted from ecoPrimals monorepo)
- GitHub Pages rendering (academic layout)
- DOI via Zenodo
- ORCID attribution
- Citable as: Mok K. (2026). *sporePrint: Sovereign Scientific Computing
  via Constrained Evolution.* ecoPrimals. doi:10.XXXX/...

### Future — guidePost/
- `guidePost/` companion repo for atlasHugged — the human, ethical, and
  philosophical side: five questions for John Galt, the orthogonal synthesis,
  the love letter, the temptation of kingdoms. The story of why, not just what.
